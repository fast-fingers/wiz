How to deploy -------->
Inside the directory of the Multiplayer-Javascript-Game/client folder enter 
npx live-server
On another cmd tab navigate to Multiplayer-Javascript-Game/server and enter
npx nodemon server.js
Keep both tabs running and open your browser and enter http://localhost:8080/blockGame.html
to join another player open another browser tab and enter the same url.


Things to add -------->
This was my very first Javascript networking experience, and some key concepts 
are not explored in this project, such as, rooms, namespaces, authentication, etc.
This repository is intended to help beginners willing to learn more about socket io through
tweaking with code.
